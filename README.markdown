VimClojure (Ant Edition)
========================

VimClojure (Ant Edition) is a Vim plug-in that provides an enhanced Clojure
editing environment, including features such as:

* Syntax highlighting
* Automatic indentation
* Omni-completion
* Documentation lookup
* Embedded Clojure REPL

The Ant Edition is a fork of [VimClojure][vimclojure] that seeks to make
VimClojure more distribution-friendly.  Particularly, it:

* Uses [Apache Ant][ant] for building instead of Gradle
* Does not embed the [NailGun][ng] source code
